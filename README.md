# PatternVis Explorer

PatternVis Explorer is an interactive system for visualizing SQL query execution as staged data flow graphs. The project is inspired by the PatternVis research paper and extends its ideas with an emphasis on interactivity and clarity.

The system transforms SQL queries into a structured pipeline of operations, allowing users to understand how data flows through joins, filters, aggregation, ordering, and final output.

## Features

- Parses SQL queries including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY
- Generates a staged graph representation of query execution
- Uses a deterministic layout to reflect execution order
- Provides clause-level highlighting by linking graph elements to SQL
- Displays edge types for joins, filters, aggregation, ordering, and output
- Includes natural-language explanations of query behavior

## Note

This project is inspired by the PatternVis paper and is a reimplementation built from scratch, with additional interactive features and design decisions.
